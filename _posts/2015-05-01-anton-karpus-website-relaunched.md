Having finished finals a few weeks ago, I'm now officially one semester away from graduating with a degree in Computer Science. Who would have that that? With some downtime, I felt I needed to update my personal website (antonkarpus.com). Decided to host using GitHub's (free) hosting service to avoid using GoDaddy at all costs. Hoping to make a periodic post on the blog with some random thoughts/pictures/findings that I come across.
